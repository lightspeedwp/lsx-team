Use the LSX Team plugin to show your website visitors the faces and names behind the business, and tell them about yourself and your team members.
 
== Description ==

The [LSX Team plugin](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/team/) adds a Team post type to your website for adding staff members or creating profiles for people on your website.  You can add a bio, contact details, job information, location, and social handles for each Team Member.  

People like to see a face behind a business, it gives you a more personal, approachable relationship with your users. 

The LSX Team plugin integrates with LSX Testimonials and LSX Projects if you are using these plugins. Linking a Team Member to a project or testimonial can be a simple solution for showing your potential customers your portfolio of work.

Use the [LSX Blocks plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lsx-blocks/) to get a Team block for building your pages more easily. Control the layout of your team posts in the block settings.
